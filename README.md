# 👋 Hi there — I'm Geoffrey Giordano

I'm a recent **Computer Science graduate from CSUSM** based in Southern California. My favorite languages right now are **Python** and **Go**, and I'm always experimenting with new technologies.

🧠 My current interests include:
- 🤖 Artificial Intelligence – building simple agents and exploring how tools can make code smarter and more autonomous.
- 🔐 Cybersecurity – diving into best‑practices for secure code, authentication and infrastructure.
- ⚙️ Clean code & maintainable software – writing readable, testable programs and automating workflows.

🎮 When I’m not coding, you can find me gaming, reading, or learning something new just for fun.

📚 Open to collaboration, learning opportunities, and cool projects. Let’s build something!
