# 👋 Hi there — I'm Geoffrey Giordano

I'm a recent **Computer Science graduate from CSUSM** based in Southern California. My favorite languages right now are **Python** and **Go**, and I'm always experimenting with new technologies.

🧠 My current interests include:
  -🤖 Artificial Intelligence – building simple agents and exploring how tools can make code smarter and more autonomous.
  -🔐 Cybersecurity – diving into best‑practices for secure code, authentication and infrastructure.
  -⚙️ Clean code & maintainable software – writing readable, testable programs and automating workflows.

🎮 When I’m not coding, you can find me gaming, reading, or learning something new just for fun.

📚 Open to collaboration, learning opportunities, and cool projects. Let’s build something!

## 🔭 Projects & Highlights
Here is an example of a repository on my GitHub that showcase my interests and learning journey:

### Lexical Analyzer GUI – Python & Tkinter
A GUI front‑end for a lexical analyzer for the TinyPie language.  It tokenizes TinyPie source code, constructs a parse tree and displays it both as text and graphically.  The application is built with **Tkinter** and uses `treelib` for tree visualization. Features include tokenizing keywords, identifiers, operators and literals, generating and visualizing parse trees, and logging tree data to a file.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Languages:** Python, Go, C/C++, Java, Javascript, F#, Prolog, SQL, ARM, MIPS
- **Software:** Windows, Linux, Microsoft Office / Google Workspace
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** Tkinter, Pygame, treelib, sqlc
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, SQLite
- **DevOps:** Git and GitHub for version control, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, Docker for containerization
- **Cloud:** Experimentation with AWS S3/CloudFront, and deploying containerized services on GCP Cloud Run
- **Research:** Data Entry, Data Structures, Embedded Systems, Linear Optimization, Numerical Analysis
